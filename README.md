## Overview

This project aims to create a decentralized platform for securely storing and trading files using blockchain technology. Users can upload files to IPFS, tokenize them as digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain, and trade them in a secure marketplace.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain:** Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), Pinata(For IPFS pinning)
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js
- **Web3 Integration:** Ethers.js
- **Database:** The Graph (For indexing blockchain data)

## Development Checkpoints

- **Setup and Research**
  - Initialize project repository
  - Research IPFS and smart contract interactions
- **Smart Contract Development**
  - Write smart contracts for file tokenization and marketplace transactions
  - Test contracts
- **IPFS Integration**
  - Implement file upload and retrieval mechanisms with IPFS
  - Store file references in smart contracts
- **Frontend Development**
  - Set up Next.js project for the frontend interface
  - Develop UI components for file uploads, marketplace, and transactions
  - Integrate frontend with smart contracts using Ethers.js
- **End-to-End Testing**
  - Test complete workflow on testnet 
  - Fix bugs and optimize based on test results
- **Deployment**
  - Deploy smart contracts to testnet 
  - Launch frontend application
- **Post-Launch**
  - Monitor platform performance
  - Iterate based on user feedback
